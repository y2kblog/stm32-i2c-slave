# STM32 I2C slave device  

This project implements an I2C slave device using the HAL library of the STM32 microcontroller.  
Set up and connect an I2C master and I2C slave on a single Nucleo board and verify operation.  

## Wiring  

- Connect D15(PB8) and A5(PC0)  
- Connect D14(PB9) and A4(PC1)
